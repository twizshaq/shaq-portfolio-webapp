Beautiful Soup (Python) - A Python library used for parsing the HTML content retrieved from the target real estate website, making it easy to extract relevant data points from the unstructured HTML.

Requests (Python) - A Python library used to make HTTP requests to the target website, fetching the HTML content that needed to be scraped.

Axios (JavaScript) - Used on the front-end to make asynchronous HTTP requests to the back-end API, sending the user's search parameters and receiving the filtered listings.


Challenges
This project presented several challenges, each contributing to a deeper understanding of web scraping and application development:

Initial Filtering Inaccuracies - The primary challenge was ensuring the filtering logic accurately reflected the user's selections. Initially, the filtering based on property type (e.g., Villa/House) was not working correctly, leading to the display of irrelevant listings (like land). This required careful analysis of the scraped data and iterative refinement of the back-end filtering logic.

Dynamic and Varied Website Structure - Websites can have inconsistent HTML structures, making it challenging to reliably extract data. I had to identify stable CSS selectors and implement robust parsing logic to handle potential variations in the target website's HTML.

Accurate Property Type Identification - Determining the correct property type from the scraped data proved difficult, as the target website didn't always use consistent terminology in the listing titles. I had to adapt the back-end filtering to analyze other data points, like the bedbath field, to improve accuracy.


Lessons Learned
This project reinforced the critical importance of data analysis and iterative development in web scraping and full-stack development. Key lessons learned include:

The Importance of Understanding the Data - Initially, I relied on the short_title for filtering property types, but analyzing the scraped data revealed that the bedbath field was a more reliable source. This highlighted the necessity of thoroughly understanding the data being scraped before implementing filtering logic.

Adaptability to Website Structure - Web scraping requires adaptability. Understanding how to identify and utilize different data points when the primary ones are insufficient is a crucial skill.

Front-End and Back-End Integration - This project provided valuable experience in integrating front-end user interactions with back-end data processing, highlighting the importance of clear API design and communication between the two layers.

##### Azure Conditional Access security project where i simulated a phishing attack
Overview & Purpose
This project involves setting up a phishing simulation with a Conditional Access Policy to safeguard user credentials from unauthorized access. In this simulation, a user would receive a phishing email containing a fake link to a login page. Upon entering their credentials, a bad actor would attempt to use these stolen credentials to gain access to the system. However, the Conditional Access Policy ensures that such unauthorized access attempts are blocked unless the request originates from a trusted home office network.


What Was Used
To build and host this project, I used a modern tech stack and various cloud services, including:

Microsoft Office 365 Outlook - For sending phishing simulation emails.

Azure Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory) - To manage users and enforce the conditional access policies.

VPN - Used to simulate login attempts from different locations to verify that only the home network IP range allows successful login.


Use Case
Phishing attacks are one of the most common ways attackers steal user credentials. In this use case, a phishing simulation is designed to test whether credentials obtained through a fake login page could be used by a malicious actor.

The conditional access policy adds an extra security layer by restricting successful logins to specific network locations, such as the trusted home office network. Even if credentials are compromised, the attacker cannot log in unless they are connected to this predefined network.

This setup aligns with zero-trust principles, ensuring that user credentials alone are not sufficient to gain access—further verifying the origin of the access attempt before allowing login.


Implementation
The policy was implemented using a network-based approach, restricting access to the following conditions:

IP Range Restriction - Only devices on the home office network can log in to the account, even with valid credentials.

Blocked IPs - All login attempts from unrecognized networks, including those using the stolen credentials from the phishing simulation, were blocked.

The policy ensures that unauthorized actors, even with compromised login details, cannot gain entry unless they are on a trusted IP address.


Challenges
This project was relatively straightforward to implement. No significant technical issues arose during configuration or testing.


Outcome
The implemented Conditional Access Policy resulted in a substantial improvement in security posture, as it blocked any login attempts from locations outside the predefined home network. This successfully mitigates the risk of unauthorized access, even in cases where credentials are stolen through phishing.


Lessons Learned
This project highlighted the importance of network-based access control as part of a comprehensive security strategy. It reinforced the effectiveness of Conditional Access Policies and demonstrated that:

Credentials alone are not enough - Location-based policies add critical context to authentication attempts.

Zero Trust Architecture - Policies like these help shift towards a more robust security model where trust is not implicit based on user credentials alone.

Continuous Improvement - Future policies could incorporate Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) or device compliance policies to further enhance security."
