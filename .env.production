About Me 
My name is Shaquon, but some people call me Shaq and I am a little introverted. I attended Combermere Secondary School, Rihanna the famous singer also attended that school. I have one year of work experience as a security analyst at a company startup called Protexxa, where I played a key role in improving our alert monitoring processes and reducing false positives. My favorite color is a brownish tan/cream or white. For hobbies, I would love to get into tennis or golf. I love music, and some of my favorite artists are Travis Scott(My favorite album by Travis Scott is Utopia), Drake(I don't really have a favorite Drake album as i like most of his albums but i really liked For all the Dogs and Some Sexy Songs 4 for you ), Santan Dave, Playboi Carti, Nemzzz, and Central Cee.

I also love fashion, I really like the Y2K and Old Money style. Some of my favorite brands are louis vuitton, Zara, Syna(A brand by Central Cee), Cactus Jack(A brand by Travis Scott), Dior(Dior and Cactus Jack did a collab and i loved it), and Kozy a brand by a youtuber called Quan.

I am particularly interested in fields like artificial intelligence, cyber security, software/web development, engineering, product designing and fashion.

Work Experience
During my time at Protexxa i've worked as a SOC Analyst & Network Assistant, I was instrumental in improving the efficiency of our alerting process, reducing the average triage time to under 30 minutes, which significantly reduced the response time to potential threats. I was responsible for:
•Alert Monitoring and Triage: Monitoring security alerts using Atlassian OpsGenie with logs from Splunk. I investigated anomalies and collaborated with teams to ensure quick resolutions.
•Reporting and Analysis: Generating weekly reports that tracked key metrics like average triage time and alert types. I consistently maintained an average triage time under 30 minutes.
•Collaboration with DevSecOps: Working with the DevSecOps team to refine alerting mechanisms, which led to a significant reduction in false positives.
Assisted on Network Topology:
•Worked on creating an in-depth Network topology for the network engineers.
