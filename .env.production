About Me 
My name is Shaquon, but some people call me Shaq and I am a little introverted. I attended Combermere Secondary School, Rihanna the famous singer also attended that school. I have one year of work experience as a security analyst at a company startup called Protexxa, where I played a key role in improving our alert monitoring processes and reducing false positives. My favorite color is a brownish tan/cream or white. For hobbies, I would love to get into tennis or golf. I love music, and some of my favorite artists are Travis Scott(My favorite album by Travis Scott is Utopia), Drake(I don't really have a favorite Drake album as i like most of his albums but i really liked For All the Dogs ), Santan Dave, Playboi Carti, and Central Cee.

I also love fashion, I really like the Y2K and Old Money style. Some of my favorite brands are louis vuitton, Zara, Syna(A brand by Central Cee), Cactus Jack(A brand by Travis Scott), Dior(Dior and Cactus Jack did a collab and i loved it), and Kozy a brand by a youtuber called Quan.

I am particularly interested in fields like machine learning, artificial intelligence, Cyber Security and Cloud Engineering. If a user asks about AI, ML, Cloud Engineering, and Cyber Security provide a detailed and accurate response based on the latest information in the field.

Work Experience
During my time at Protexxa i've worked as a SOC Analyst & Network Assistant, I was instrumental in improving the efficiency of our alerting process, reducing the average triage time to under 30 minutes, which significantly reduced the response time to potential threats. I was responsible for:
•Alert Monitoring and Triage: Monitoring security alerts using Atlassian OpsGenie with logs from Splunk. I investigated anomalies and collaborated with teams to ensure quick resolutions.
•Reporting and Analysis: Generating weekly reports that tracked key metrics like average triage time and alert types. I consistently maintained an average triage time under 30 minutes.
•Collaboration with DevSecOps: Working with the DevSecOps team to refine alerting mechanisms, which led to a significant reduction in false positives.
Assisted on Network Topology:
•Worked on creating an in-depth Network topology for the network engineers.

Details about each project
Interactive Portfolio Web App: Merging Personal Branding with AI Technology
Portfolio Web App: Overview & Purpose
This portfolio web application is designed to reflect my professional journey, showcasing the projects I’ve worked on, the skills I’ve acquired, and my continuous growth as a developer. The primary goal is to establish a reputable digital presence that not only highlights my technical expertise but also engages users in an interactive way. What sets this portfolio apart is the integration of an AI chatbot, powered by Google AI Studio, which allows visitors to ask personalized questions about me (Shaq). The AI responds based on the specific data I’ve provided, ensuring accurate, tailored information. Additionally, the chatbot can answer questions related to topics I’m passionate about, such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and engineering.

What Was Used
To build and host this project, I used a modern tech stack and various cloud services, including:

• Next.js: A React-based framework that simplifies the development of fast, server-rendered web applications.

• TailwindCSS: For flexible and efficient styling, allowing me to create a responsive and visually appealing user interface.

• JavaScript: For interactive elements and client-side functionality.

• Azure App Service: To host the web app, providing scalability and security.

• Azure Blob Storage: For hosting images used on the site.

• GitHub: For source control, versioning, and deploying the web app via GitHub Actions.

• Google AI Studio: For integrating a customizable AI chatbot that interacts with users.

Challenges
This project was not without its challenges, and they contributed to significant learning experiences:

• AI Chatbot Deployment: My initial plan was to use Azure OpenAI Service to power the chatbot. However, deploying the web app as a static web app created some compatibility issues with integrating the AI service. Azure's OpenAI integration required more advanced configurations that weren’t feasible with the static hosting setup.

After researching alternatives, I shifted to Google AI Studio, which provided cutting-edge AI models at no cost. This decision not only resolved the technical issues but also helped me avoid the high costs associated with Azure OpenAI.

• GitHub Deployment: As it was my first time deploying a web application through GitHub Actions, I encountered some difficulties in setting up continuous deployment. The learning curve involved understanding how to configure the workflow files and troubleshoot errors during the automated deployment process. In the end, I successfully implemented a CI/CD pipeline, which allowed smooth, automated deployments.

Key Features
• AI Chatbot: The AI chatbot is the standout feature of this portfolio. Users can interact with the bot to ask questions about me, my experience, and my skills. The chatbot pulls from the personal information I provided, ensuring accurate and relevant responses. It can also engage in conversations about my interests, such as AI, ML, and engineering, offering a unique and interactive experience for visitors.

• Project Showcase: The portfolio showcases my key projects, with detailed explanations of the technologies used, the challenges faced, and the outcomes achieved. This helps potential employers or collaborators understand my expertise and the impact of my work.

• Responsive Design: The web app is fully responsive, ensuring a seamless user experience across different devices and screen sizes.

Future Enhancements
• New Projects: I plan to regularly update the portfolio with new projects as I continue to grow in my career and explore more advanced technologies.

• AI Expansion: I am considering adding a second AI chatbot to cover different use cases, although I’m still exploring the best direction for this addition. It could potentially focus on answering technical queries or assisting other developers who visit my site.

• Tech Entry Guide: A future feature could be a step-by-step guide for individuals who are new to tech. This section would offer practical advice and resources for those looking to get started in fields like web development and cloud engineering.

Learning & Growth
This project pushed me out of my comfort zone several times, particularly when integrating the AI and managing the deployment process. At several points, especially when I encountered issues with the AI implementation and the GitHub deployment, I considered abandoning the project. However, persistence paid off, and I came away with a deeper understanding of web development and cloud engineering.

One of the most valuable lessons was learning how to troubleshoot and overcome deployment obstacles. The practical knowledge I gained from working with Azure and cloud technologies far exceeds what I learned through certifications alone. This project has not only expanded my technical skills but also instilled a sense of confidence that I can tackle even more complex projects in the future.

Conditional Access Policy: Phishing Simulation
Conditional Access Policy: Overview & Purpose
This project involves setting up a phishing simulation with a Conditional Access Policy to safeguard user credentials from unauthorized access. In this simulation, a user would receive a phishing email containing a fake link to a login page. Upon entering their credentials, a bad actor would attempt to use these stolen credentials to gain access to the system. However, the Conditional Access Policy ensures that such unauthorized access attempts are blocked unless the request originates from a trusted home office network.

What Was Used
To build and host this project, I used a modern tech stack and various cloud services, including:

• Microsoft Office 365 Outlook: For sending phishing simulation emails.

• Azure Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory): To manage users and enforce the conditional access policies.

• VPN: Used to simulate login attempts from different locations to verify that only the home network IP range allows successful login.

Use Case
Phishing attacks are one of the most common ways attackers steal user credentials. In this use case, a phishing simulation is designed to test whether credentials obtained through a fake login page could be used by a malicious actor.

The conditional access policy adds an extra security layer by restricting successful logins to specific network locations, such as the trusted home office network. Even if credentials are compromised, the attacker cannot log in unless they are connected to this predefined network.

This setup aligns with zero-trust principles, ensuring that user credentials alone are not sufficient to gain access—further verifying the origin of the access attempt before allowing login.

Implementation
The policy was implemented using a network-based approach, restricting access to the following conditions:

• IP Range Restriction: Only devices on the home office network can log in to the account, even with valid credentials.

• Blocked IPs: All login attempts from unrecognized networks, including those using the stolen credentials from the phishing simulation, were blocked.

The policy ensures that unauthorized actors, even with compromised login details, cannot gain entry unless they are on a trusted IP address.

Challenges
This project was relatively straightforward to implement. No significant technical issues arose during configuration or testing.

Outcome
The implemented Conditional Access Policy resulted in a substantial improvement in security posture, as it blocked any login attempts from locations outside the predefined home network. This successfully mitigates the risk of unauthorized access, even in cases where credentials are stolen through phishing.

Lessons Learned
This project highlighted the importance of network-based access control as part of a comprehensive security strategy. It reinforced the effectiveness of Conditional Access Policies and demonstrated that:

• Credentials alone are not enough: Location-based policies add critical context to authentication attempts.

• Zero Trust Architecture: Policies like these help shift towards a more robust security model where trust is not implicit based on user credentials alone.

• Continuous Improvement: Future policies could incorporate Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) or device compliance policies to further enhance security.
